```yaml
# Change this:
ports:
  - "3001:8080"

# To this (example):
ports:
  - "3002:8080"
```

### Images Won't Pull

**Verify images exist:**
1. Check images on Docker Hub:
   - https://hub.docker.com/r/mvyas7/job-hunt-ai-backend
   - https://hub.docker.com/r/mvyas7/job-hunt-ai-frontend
2. Try manual pull:
   ```bash
   docker pull mvyas7/job-hunt-ai-backend:latest
   docker pull mvyas7/job-hunt-ai-frontend:latest
   ```

### Backend Health Check Failing

Wait longer - the backend needs time to:
1. Start the Python application
2. Connect to Elasticsearch
3. Connect to Neo4j
4. Download NLP models (first run)

This can take 2-3 minutes on first startup.

### Frontend Can't Connect to Backend

**Check backend is running:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

**Check Docker network:**
```bash
docker network inspect jobmatch_network
```

### Out of Disk Space

**Clean up Docker:**
```bash
# Remove unused containers and images
docker system prune -a

# Remove volumes (WARNING: deletes data)
docker volume prune
```

## System Requirements

### Minimum

- Docker Desktop
- 8GB RAM
- 10GB disk space
- 2 CPU cores

### Recommended

- 16GB RAM
- 20GB disk space
- 4 CPU cores
- SSD storage

## Architecture Overview

### System Flow Diagram

![JobMatch AI System Architecture](images/jobMatchAI-FlowDiagram.png)

The system architecture consists of three main components:

1. **Data Ingestion Pipeline (Offline)**
   - Ingests jobs from external sources (Rise, LinkedIn) and user queries/resumes
   - Processes data through NLP Service using SBERT embeddings and NER
   - Stores entities and relations in Neo4j Knowledge Graph
   - Indexes job text in Elasticsearch for fast retrieval

2. **Online Search & Ranking**
   - **Hybrid Search Service**: Combines three search strategies
     - Graph Traversal: Finds jobs via skill relationships in Neo4j
     - Vector Search: Semantic similarity matching using embeddings
     - BM25 Retrieval: Traditional keyword-based search from Elasticsearch
   - **Candidate Fusion**: Intelligently merges results from all three approaches

3. **Explainable Reranking**
   - **Reranking Service**: Uses deterministic utility function to score jobs
   - Computes factor scores based on Skills, Experience, Location, and Salary
   - **Generative Layer**: Anthropic Claude LLM provides natural language explanations
   - Delivers ranked results with transparent explanations to the frontend

## Advanced Usage

### Ingesting Jobs via REST API

The backend provides a REST API endpoint to ingest jobs from CSV files. This endpoint processes the CSV and imports jobs into both Elasticsearch and Neo4j databases.

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/csv/ingest-csv`

**Parameters**:
- `file`: CSV file to upload (required)
- `index_to_elasticsearch`: Index jobs to Elasticsearch (default: true)
- `create_neo4j_nodes`: Create Neo4j nodes (default: true)
- `process_with_nlp`: Process jobs with NLP (default: true)
- `batch_size`: Number of jobs to process per batch (default: 100)

**Example using curl:**

```bash
# Basic ingestion with default parameters
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/csv/ingest-csv" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@jobs/SDE-Nov21.csv"

# Advanced ingestion with custom parameters
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/csv/ingest-csv" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@jobs/SDE-Nov21.csv" \
  -F "index_to_elasticsearch=true" \
  -F "create_neo4j_nodes=true" \
  -F "process_with_nlp=true" \
  -F "batch_size=50"
```

**Response**:
The API will return a JSON response with ingestion statistics:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "jobs_processed": 1234,
  "elasticsearch_indexed": 1234,
  "neo4j_nodes_created": 1234,
  "processing_time": "45.2s"
}
```

**Note**: The ingestion process may take several minutes depending on the CSV size and whether NLP processing is enabled. For large CSV files (10,000+ jobs), consider using a smaller batch size (e.g., 50) to avoid memory issues.

### Custom Data

To load your own job data:

1. Prepare JSON file with job listings
2. Copy to backend container:
   ```bash
   docker cp jobs.json jobmatch_backend:/app/
   ```
3. Load data:
   ```bash
   docker exec jobmatch_backend python -m app.scripts.load_jobs jobs.json
   ```

### API Examples

**Search jobs:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/search?query=python+developer"
```

**Get job by ID:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/jobs/1"
```

**Upload resume:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/resume/analyze" \
  -F "file=@resume.pdf"
```
